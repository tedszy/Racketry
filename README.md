# Racketry

Exercises and projects in computer science using Racket.

## SICP

I have added some Racket style to the SICP
exercises. That is, the use of structs where
convenient, the use of named-let, unit testing,
modules, and other Racket features whenever 
they make the code look better and do not defeat 
the purpose of the exercise. Also, some SICP 
examples in the text of the book are refactored 
in various ways that I found interesting or 
enlightening.
