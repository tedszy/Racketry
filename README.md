# Racketry
SICP exercises and other Racket projects.

I have added some Racket style to the SICP
exercises. That is, the use of structs where
convenient, the use of named-let, unit testing
and other Racket features. For-iteration is 
used whenever it makes the code look better 
and does not defeat the purpose of the exercise.
