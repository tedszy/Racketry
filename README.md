# Racketry

Exercises and projects in computer science using Racket.

## SICP Revisited

I have added some Racket style to the SICP
exercises: the use of structs where
convenient, the use of named-let, unit testing,
modules and other Racket features whenever 
they make the code look better and do not defeat 
the purpose of the exercise. I also take opportunities
to practice using multiple return values, point-free-style code,
Racket for-loops, continuations, macros, struct generics,
and other language features or styles of programming.

Some SICP examples in the text of the book are refactored 
in various ways that I found interesting or 
enlightening. Procedures are given longer, more
descriptive names. Interesting problems provide opportunities for
going on tangents: there are many of those in SICP.

* **SICP part 1.** Intro, expressions, evaluation models, 
roots, adaptive roots, factorials, recursion, Ackermann function, 
binomials, fibonacci numbers, estimating order of growth of computations, 
change-making problems, computing sin(x), tail-recursion, exponentiation, 
advanced ways of computing Fibonacci numbers, gcds and Lame's theorem.



## Projects

* Investigation of Lambda-calculus (based on an exercise in SICP.) 

* Generating Sierpinski's triangle with Racket graphics.
