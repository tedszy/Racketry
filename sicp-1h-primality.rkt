;; Theta(sqrt(n)) order of growth primality test. 
;;
;; Find the smallest divisor >= 2 of n.
;; We try divisors d up to d^2 <= n. 
;;
;; If remainder of n/d is 0, then answer is d.
;; If no divisor such that d^2 <= n is found then
;; n itself is the only such divisor. 
;; And n is therefore prime. 
;;
;; Why? Because if d|n then n/d also | d. It's not
;; possible that both are larger than sqrt(n) because
;; if so then d * d/n would be > n. So one of these
;; divisors must be smaller than sqrt(n). If there isn't
;; one below sqrt(n) then there isn't one bigger than
;; sqrt(n) either.
